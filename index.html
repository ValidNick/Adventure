        <p class="info" > Hello, fellow adventurer, Ameritsu needs your help! His little sister is sick and it's up to you help him find the cure. Rumor has it that there is a fabled golden apple that can save her life and cure her sickness. It tends to grow in places lacking light and filled with water. It's rumored to giver birth to strange anomalies. Will you help us?</p>

                <p> Really? Thank you so much! To get started on your journey you must first figure out where the apple is. Here is a map that will show you 3 different locations that you must decide where the apple may lay based on their description. Once you've made your decision click on which option you believe is the right location.(Hint: reread the previous page)</p>

Hundreds of concession stands, theme restaurants and bistros offer a plethora of culinary choices and those who feel hungry for something else can enjoy adventure sports, sport activities, theaters or one of the many other recreational venues. </p>
